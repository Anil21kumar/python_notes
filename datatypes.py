 # int=integer like = single digit or multiple digit like 1,2,-1,-2,123,1234,564,soonnn
 # flot =floting which comes in . in between numbers =1.5,11.22,134.44.,35.44 ,,,,,
 # complex = it comes with letter "j" like =a=1+2j,b=5j,c=9-2j,.....

 # strings = in python string is a secquence of charecters 
 # which is enclosed between single quecations('--') or double quecations ("----")
