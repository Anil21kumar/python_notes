# arthematic operators

# the arthamatic operators are used for mathamatical calucations 
# + (Addition)
a=10
b=10
c=a+b
print("value of c",c)
# value of c 20

# - (Subtraction)
z=20
x=2
c=z-x
print("value of c",c)
# value of c is 18

# * (Multiplication)
a=2
b=3
c=a*b
print("value of c",c)
# value of c is 6

# / (Division)
a=8
b=2
c=a/b
print("value of c",c)
# value of c 4.0

# % (Modulo - remainder of division)
a=8
b=50
c=a%b
print("value of c",c)
# value of c 10

# // (Floor division - division rounded down to the nearest whole number)
# ** (Exponentiation)

# Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables.
# = (Assignment)
# += (Add and assign)
# -= (Subtract and assign)
# *= (Multiply and assign)
# /= (Divide and assign)
# %=  (Modulo and assign)
# //= (Floor divide and assign)
# **= (Exponentiate and assign)


# Comparison Operators: Used to compare two values.

# == (Equal to)
# != (Not equal to)
# > (Greater than)
# < (Less than)
# >= (Greater than or equal to)
# <= (Less than or equal to)
