# to create a veriable using alfanumaric ex=(ab12=1000) where ab12 is a veriable and "=" is an opareter and 1000 is a value
# it should not start with numbers or any special charectors like !@#$%^&*()all
# there one special charecter that we can use to create that is unerscore "_ _" 
# examples like 1= anil=10 ,  _anil = 10 ,_anil123=10 ,ANIL=10 ,
# while creating veriable lowercase and uppercase letters are imoptent to observe
# key words are not allowed 
# like==( false,true,non, and, or, not, in, isif, elif, else,for, while, break, continue,.def, class, with, as, pass, lambda,return, yield, import, from,try, except, raise, finally,  assertasync, await,del, global, nonlocal)

# all these are key words each have specific meaning that stored in python librery
# veriable is a tempevary memory location 
# we can change the data us per user needed
